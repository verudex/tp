### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePatientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Patient` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/doctorwho/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `doctorwho.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### NRIC validation feature

#### Context

NRIC/FIN is a core patient identifier and must be validated strictly. The app validates NRIC in two layers:

1. **Structure check**: first letter + seven digits + checksum letter.
2. **Checksum check**: Singapore NRIC/FIN modulus-11 checksum, including prefix-specific letter tables.

This prevents malformed or checksum-invalid NRIC values from entering the model.

#### Where validation happens

Validation is centralized in `Nric` (model), instead of being duplicated in parser/storage:

* `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` parse the `ic/` value and construct `Nric`.
* `JsonAdaptedPatient` also constructs `Nric` during JSON deserialization.
* `Nric#isValidNric(String)` is therefore the single source of truth for all input paths.

This design guarantees consistent behavior for CLI input, test fixtures, and persisted data loading.

#### Checksum algorithm

For an NRIC/FIN value with prefix `P`, digits `d1..d7`, and suffix letter `L`:

1. Compute weighted sum using weights `[2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]`.
2. Add prefix offset:
   * `+4` for `T` and `G`
   * `+3` for `M`
   * `+0` for `S` and `F`
3. Compute `remainder = sum mod 11`.
4. Compute `checkDigit = 11 - (remainder + 1)`.
5. Map `checkDigit` to letter table based on prefix group:
   * `S/T -> ABCDEFGHIZJ`
   * `F/G -> KLMNPQRTUWX`
   * `M   -> KLJNPQRTUWX`

NRIC is valid only if computed suffix letter equals `L`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: location of checksum logic**

* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** keep checksum logic in `Nric`.
  * Pros: one validation implementation across parser, model, and storage.
  * Cons: parser tests must use checksum-valid NRIC fixtures.

* **Alternative 2:** validate in parser only.
  * Pros: simpler parser flow.
  * Cons: invalid values could still enter through storage or future non-parser paths.

#### Tests

NRIC behavior is covered by:

* `NricTest`: constructor guardrails, normalization, format checks, checksum-valid and checksum-invalid cases.
* `AddCommandParserTest`: invalid NRIC parsing failures.
* `JsonAdaptedPatientTest`: invalid NRIC in JSON rejected during conversion.

In addition, shared test fixtures (e.g., `TypicalPatients`, `PatientBuilder`) use checksum-valid NRIC values to avoid false failures.

**Additional checksum-valid NRIC test values (You may copy and use these):**

### \[Proposed\] Automated Appointment Reminders

The proposed appointment reminder feature will alert the doctor of any upcoming appointments within the next 24 hours upon launching the application or while it is running.

#### Proposed Implementation

* A `ReminderManager` class will be added to the `Logic` component.
* `ReminderManager` will periodically query the `Model` for patients with an `Appointment` whose start time falls within a specific threshold (e.g., next 24 hours).
* The `UI` will be updated to include a `ReminderPanel` that observes the `ReminderManager` and displays upcoming appointments in a dedicated side panel or via visual indicators next to patient names.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: trigger mechanism for reminder refresh**

* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** hybrid trigger (`Model` change events + periodic refresh).
  * Pros: reminders stay up to date after command execution and remain accurate as time passes.
  * Pros: avoids heavy continuous polling while app is idle.
  * Cons: requires careful scheduling/lifecycle management to avoid duplicate refreshes.

* **Alternative 2:** fixed-interval polling only.
  * Pros: simpler implementation model.
  * Cons: can introduce stale reminders between poll intervals or unnecessary background work.

**Aspect: reminder presentation strategy**

* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** non-blocking reminder panel with optional visual markers.
  * Pros: supports continuous workflow without forcing modal interactions.
  * Pros: allows users to review reminders alongside patient data.
  * Cons: reminders may be less noticeable if users ignore side panels.

* **Alternative 2:** modal pop-up alerts.
  * Pros: high visibility for urgent reminders.
  * Cons: interrupts command flow and can be intrusive when multiple reminders are due.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of patient contacts, and appointments.
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* may vary in technological confidence but prefers efficient keyboard-driven interaction

**Value proposition**: manage patient details like chronic conditions, severe allergies, and appointment scheduling
faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### **Data Handling & Validation**
1. Include support for slashes (/) in patient name. Currently, we ask the user to remove slashes when entering the
   patient's name. However, this means that the stored patient name may not match their exact government name. We
   plan to implement apostrophe string enclosing to allow such special characters to be included in the name without
   conflicting with the special characters used for the argument prefixes.
2. Include cross-checks between a patient's date of birth and NRIC. Currently, we don't check that the patient's birth
   year matches their NRIC due to complexities and edge cases. Additionally, patients born before 1968 won't have their
   birth year as the first two digits of their NRIC, making this impossible in certain cases. We plan to implement a
   best-effort check that will flag possible mismatches.

### **Safety & Error Prevention**
3. Include confirmation for the `clear` command to protect the user from unintentionally clearing all their data. We
   plan to make it so that the user has to enter two consecutive clear commands before the data is actually cleared.

### **Patient Information Enhancements**
4. Include support for tagging patients as "High Risk". This feature allows doctors to quickly identify patients who 
   require extra caution. We plan to implement this as a visual indicator (e.g., tags or highlights) in the patient 
   profile to improve visibility and awareness during consultations.
5. Include support for marking allergies as "Severe". Currently, all allergies are treated equally.
   We plan to allow certain allergies to be flagged as severe so that they stand out more prominently in the patient profile.
6. Include a confirmation step before permanently deleting a patient record. This will help prevent accidental data 
   loss by requiring the user to confirm their intent before deletion is executed.
7. Include support for recording a patient's blood type. This feature would allow doctors to quickly access critical 
   information in emergency situations.

### **Search & Analysis Features**
8. Include functionality to list all patients taking a specific medication. This would be useful in scenarios such as 
   drug recalls or supply shortages, allowing doctors to quickly identify affected patients.

### **Advanced Medical Context**
9. Include support for linking related patients. This would allow doctors to identify family members and observe
   potential hereditary patterns in medical conditions.
10. Include support for attaching external specialist notes to a patient's record. This would provide a more 
    comprehensive view of the patient's medical history and ongoing care.

### **Advanced User Features**
11. Include support for chaining commands together. This would allow advanced users to execute multiple actions in a 
    single command (e.g., adding a patient and scheduling their first appointment), improving efficiency for advanced users.

## **Appendix: Effort**

**Difficulty level**: DoctorWho is significantly more complex than AB3. While AB3 manages a single entity type (Person), DoctorWho manages two entity types (Patient and Appointment) with relationships between them, requiring changes across all architectural layers.

**Challenges faced**:
- Implementing the `Appointment` entity required changes across Logic, Model, Storage and UI layers simultaneously
- Refactoring the generic `Tag` class into two specialised subclasses (`Allergy` and `Condition`) with separate validation rules, character limits and regex patterns required careful design to maintain extensibility
- Implementing overlap detection across all patients' appointments required non-trivial logic in the Model layer
- Updating the UI to include a dedicated `PatientDetailPanel` alongside the existing list panel required significant JavaFX work

**Effort**: Approximately equivalent to 1.5x the effort of AB3, given the addition of a second entity type and the tag hierarchy refactor.

**Achievements**:
- Successfully delivered all 7 MVP features on time
- Introduced a clean tag hierarchy (`Tag` → `Allergy`/`Condition`) that is easily extensible for future tag types
- Improved UI with a split-panel layout showing patient details alongside the patient list
