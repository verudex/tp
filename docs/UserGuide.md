Do you prefer typing information than having to click on multiple things? DoctorWho is for you!

DoctorWho is a **desktop app for managing patient information and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DoctorWho
can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Can DoctorWho help you?

Yes, if your clinic is still:

- Using paper filing to keep track of your patients and their appointments.
- Dealing with long search times in Excel.
- Paying exorbitant fees for enterprise grade software to track a handful of patients.

## Quick start

1. First, make sure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer!<br>
   **Mac users:** Check out [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to get the
   exact JDK version you need.

2. Next, download the latest `doctorwho.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/releases).

3. Then, move the `doctorwho.jar` file to the folder where you want to keep your contacts (we suggest you place it in a
   new, empty folder!)
   ![Moving .jar file to folder](images/ShiftJarFile.gif)

4. Now, open up a command terminal, go to the folder where `doctorwho.jar` is, and use the `java -jar doctorwho.jar`
   command to run the application. You've just taken your first step toward managing contacts quickly!
   ![Opening the .jar file](images/OpeningJarFile.gif)

5. You should now see some sample data. This is what DoctorWho will look like!
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all patients.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe`
      to the list of patients.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

    * `apt 3 d/12-03-2026 14:00 dur/30 note/Routine Checkup` : Schedule an appointment for the 3rd patient
      shown in the current list.

    * `lsapt d/12-03-2026` : List appointments for 12th March 2026.

    * `dapt 3` : Remove an appointment from the 3rd patient shown on the list.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command, and [Command Summary](#command-summary) gives
   you a quick cheatsheet in case you forget.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [al/ALLERGY]` can be used as `n/John Doe al/Aspirin` or as `n/John Doe`.
  E.g `n/NAME [c/CONDITION]` can be used as `n/Johnny c/High BP` or as `n/Johnny`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[al/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `al/Penicillin`, `al/Ibuprofen al/Aspirin` etc.]

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Storage:

### Saving the data

DoctorWho data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

### Editing the data file

DoctorWho data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/DoctorWho.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DoctorWho will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the DoctorWho to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous DoctorWho home folder.
