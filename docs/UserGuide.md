Do you prefer typing information than having to click on multiple things? DoctorWho is for you!

DoctorWho is a **desktop app for managing patient information and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DoctorWho
can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Can DoctorWho help you?

Yes, if your clinic is still:

- Using paper filing to keep track of your patients and their appointments.
- Dealing with long search times in Excel.
- Paying exorbitant fees for enterprise grade software to track a handful of patients.

## Quick start

Don't worry if you're not tech-savvy — just follow these steps one by one and you'll be up and running in no time!

1. First, make sure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer. Not sure if you have it? Open a terminal and type `java -version` — if you see a version number of 17 or higher, you're good to go!<br>
   **Mac users:** Check out [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to get the exact JDK version you need.

2. Next, download the latest `doctorwho.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/releases). You'll find it under the **Assets** section of the latest release — just click on `doctorwho.jar` to download it.

3. Move the `doctorwho.jar` file to the folder where you'd like to store your patient data. We recommend creating a brand new empty folder for this (e.g. a folder named `DoctorWho` on your Desktop), so everything stays neat and tidy.

   ![Moving .jar file to folder](images/ShiftingJarFile.png)

4. Now, let's launch the app! Open a command terminal in your `DoctorWho` folder:

   - **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Search for **Terminal** in Spotlight or your app menu.

   Then, navigate to your folder. For example, if you placed it on your Desktop in a folder called `DoctorWho`, type:
```
   cd Desktop/DoctorWho
```
   - Finally, run the app with:
```
   java -jar doctorwho.jar
```

5. DoctorWho will launch with some sample data so you can explore right away — it should look something like this:

   ![DoctorWho UI](images/Ui.png)

6. Type a command in the command box at the top and press **Enter** to run it. Here are a few to try out:

   * `list` — Lists all patients.
   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` — Adds a patient named `John Doe`.
   * `delete 3` — Deletes the 3rd patient in the current list.
   * `apt 3 d/01-04-2026 09:00 dur/60 note/Follow-up for diabetes review` — Schedules an appointment for the 3rd patient.
   * `lsapt d/12-03-2026` — List appointments for 12th March 2026.
   * `dapt 3` — Removes the appointment from the 3rd patient.

7. When you're ready to explore more, check out the [Features](#features) section for the full command details, or jump to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) for a quick cheatsheet!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [al/ALLERGY]` can be used as `n/John Doe al/Aspirin` or as `n/John Doe`.
  E.g `n/NAME [c/CONDITION]` can be used as `n/Johnny c/High BP` or as `n/Johnny`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[al/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `al/Penicillin`, `al/Ibuprofen al/Aspirin` etc.]

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Storage:

### Saving the data

DoctorWho data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

### Editing the data file

DoctorWho data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/DoctorWho.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DoctorWho will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the DoctorWho to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous DoctorWho home folder.
