Do you prefer typing information than having to click on multiple things? DoctorWho is for you!

DoctorWho is a **desktop app for managing patient information and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DoctorWho can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Can DoctorWho help you?
Yes, if your clinic is still:
- Using paper filing to keep track of your patients and their appointments.
- Dealing with long search times in Excel.
- Paying exorbitant fees for enterprise grade software to track a handful of patients.

## Quick start

1. First, make sure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer!<br>
   **Mac users:** Check out [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to get the exact JDK version you need.

2. Next, download the latest `doctorwho.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/releases).

3. Then, move the `doctorwho.jar` file to the folder where you want to keep your contacts (we suggest you place it in a new, empty folder!)
   ![Moving .jar file to folder](images/ShiftJarFile.gif)

4. Now, open up a command terminal, go to the folder where `doctorwho.jar` is, and use the `java -jar doctorwho.jar` command to run the application. You've just taken your first step toward managing contacts quickly!
   ![Opening the .jar file](images/OpeningJarFile.gif)

5. You should now see some sample data. This is what DoctorWho will look like!

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all patients.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the list of patients.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

    * `apt 3 d/01-04-2026 09:00 dur/60 note/Follow-up for diabetes review` : Schedule an appointment for the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

    * `dapt 3` : Remove an appointment from the 3rd patient shown on the list.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command, and [Command Summary](#command-summary) gives you a quick cheatsheet in case you forget.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [al/ALLERGY]` can be used as `n/John Doe al/Aspirin` or as `n/John Doe`.
  E.g `n/NAME [c/CONDITION]` can be used as `n/Johnny c/High BP` or as `n/Johnny`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[al/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `al/Penicillin`, `al/Ibuprofen al/Aspirin` etc.]

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous DoctorWho home folder.
